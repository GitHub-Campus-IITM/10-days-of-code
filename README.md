# 10 Days Of Code
GitHub coding community inside IIT Madras is thinking to host 10 days of code program. You will be working on an open-source project for 10 days either as a mentor or participant or both.

Mentor: The manager of the project. Will be assigning tasks to the participants, submitting project ideas, record progress and code.

Participant: Will work on a project assigned according to the guidance of the mentor.

You can be the only mentor or participant. You can only join only one project which will be assigned to you. First, we will select the mentors. Then we will select the participants. If someone gets rejected as a mentor, he/she can register as a participant. UG Freshies can only apply as a participant. Students outside IIT Madras can only apply as a participant.

## Mentors' registration
If you have a good project idea, apply for that project. Now if the project gets approved, you'll be the mentor of the project. Then you can take 4 participants at most and code your idea and submit it.
If your idea doesn't get selected you can apply as a participant in other projects. But, we will try to approve most of the ideas.
